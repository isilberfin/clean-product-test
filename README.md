# clean-product-test
#### **I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project as it resonated with my personal commitment to use clean products for my skin. Being someone who pays close attention to the products I use, it was incredibly rewarding to invest my efforts in creating a project that reflects my dedication to careful skincare choices.**
#### In order to use this project you can either load the picture of Ingredients list of your product or you can capture from the video and then analyze the list of ingredients

### **Project Steps**
1. **Image Capture:** The project incorporates *OpenCV*, a popular computer vision library, to capture pictures from videos or process uploaded images.

2. **Text Detection:** Leveraging the capabilities of the *Keras-OCR API*, the project applies OCR algorithms to detect and extract text from the captured or uploaded images.

3. **Chemical Detection:** The extracted text is then compared against a pre-prepared list of chemicals. By utilizing this list, the project determines whether any of the detected text corresponds to known chemicals.
